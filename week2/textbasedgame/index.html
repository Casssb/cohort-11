          You wake up feeling groggy <br />
          Instead of working on learning how to code <br />
          You've spent last week playing Skyrim non-stop (on your new fridge)
          <br />
          You open your eyes slowly expecting to see your monitor with
          yesterdays work<br />
          (you must have fallen asleep at your desk again) <br />
          But instead a strange scene unfolds before you...
        </p>

          <figcaption>"Hey, you, you're finally awake?"</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="game description">
          You look to your left and see a beautiful winter landscape <br />
          And to your right is a cart with several strangely dressed people<br />
          Has Todd Howard finally worked out how to install Skyrim directly into
          your mind!!!? <br />
        </p>
        <p class="game-description">
          The man in front of you starts speaking again: <br />
          "So, I hear you're an HTML hotshot?" <br />
          (Wait what?! Wasn't he supposed to say something about crossing the
          boarder?) <br />
          "Enter your details if you want to escape the loop..." <br />
          (The loop?)
        </p>
        <form action="#">
          <fieldset>
            <legend>Your details...</legend>
            <div class="form-elem">
              <label for="first-name">First name:</label>
              <input type="text" name="first-name" id="first-name" required />
            </div>
            <div class="form-elem">
              <label for="second-name">Second Name:</label>
              <input type="text" name="second-name" id="second-name" required>
            </div>
          </fieldset>
        </form>
        <p class="game-description">"So $first-name $second-name I hear you've been having some trouble making semantic HTML stick?" <br>
            (wait, can he read my mind?) <br>
            <button><a href="pages/question1.html">Yeah, I don't get it just use a div!</a></button> <button><a href="pages/reset.html">No, I'm good (Just let me get back to playing actual Skyrim!)</a></button>
