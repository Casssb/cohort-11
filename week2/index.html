        <p>
          I'm really enjoying learning to code and almost can't believe people
          get paid to do something so fun! <br />
          I managed to ignite my interest in coding through pure luck! <br />
          My hobby of many years has been producing electronic music and a few
          months ago I experienced a hard-drive crash. <br />
          I managed to lose around 4 years of work (yeah I know I'm a complete
          idiot for not backing anything up!) <br />
          This made me lose interest a little bit and look for a new hobby.
          Someone kindly recommended I try programming. <br />
          I did the Harvard CS50 course online and have been hooked ever
          since!
